#Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!

#The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

#For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:

#BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2

#Your code should read in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length of the hypotenuse (BC). You will probably find math.sqrt() to be useful.

#Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

#Enter the length of AB: 3

#Enter the length of AC: 4

#The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0

def main():
    # Ask the user to enter a measurement in feet
    feet = float(input("Enter measurement in feet: "))

    # Convert feet to inches (12 inches in 1 foot)
    inches = feet * 12

    # Print the result
    print(f"{feet} feet is {inches} inches.")

# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
